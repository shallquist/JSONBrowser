# JSONBrowser
JSON Browser is an iOS application that will display the contents of a JSON Object in a tree view. It is written in Swift 2.2 with iOS 9.3 libraries.

JSONBrowser is a simple app that will display the JSON Data in a tableView as a typical tree view.  To run the sample data used in this project you will need a MapQuest app key which can be acquired at [MapQuest] (https://developer.mapquest.com/).  The MapQuest key is assigned to the MAPQUEST_KEY variable within the AppDelegate.swift file.
